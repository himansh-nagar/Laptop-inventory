laptop-invertory-management
This is the backend of my laptop inventory management application and the source code is written in node js (javascript)
I have used MySQL database with migration and Sequelize query(ORM) to store data

Requirements and execution
You need to clone the repo `git clone `.
Install all the dependencies in your local by running npm install command on your terminal.
now after setup everything run nodemon server.js or node server.js to run backend.
